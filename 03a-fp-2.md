# (Tail) Recursion

- Write a recursive definition of the modulo operation (`%`) without using the `%`, `*` or `/` operators.
	```scala
def mod(x: Int, y: Int) = ???
	```
- Write a tail recursive definition of `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`
	```scala
def fib(n: Int) = ???
	```
- Write a recursive definition of `balanced` that checks for a given string, if the number of opening and closing parentheses match.
	```scala
String s = "Hans"
s.length()  // 4
s(1)  // 'a'
	```
	```scala
def balanced(s: String): boolean = ???
	```



# Higher Order Functions and Currying

Consider the following `greet` functions:

```scala
def greet1(name: String) =
	println("Hello, " + name)

def greet2(name: String) =
	println("Guten Morgen, " + name)

greet1("Maria")
greet2("Hans")
```

To abstract over the greeting formula, write a curried function, that first accepts the greeting, and the resulting function accepts the name.
Practice both long and shorthand syntax.


# Basic Cons List

Recall the implementations of the `List` trait: `Cons` and `Nil`.
- Define a list of 1, 2, ..., 5
- Write a recursive definition of `len[T](li: List[T]): Int` that computes the length of the list.
- Write a recursive definition of `get[T](li: List[T], i: Int)` that returns the `i`-th element of the list.
- Write a recursive definition of `reverse[T](li: List[T]): List[T]` that returns a list in reverse order; use the `::` operator to construct a `Cons`, which takes an element on the left hand side and a list on the right hand side.


# Merge Sort

Write a recursive merge sort using `match` expressions and list comprehension.


# Higher Order List Functions

- Write a function `def removeAt[T](xs:List[T], i: Int): List[T] = ???` that removes the `i`-th element.
- Write a function `flatten`, which takes a list and flattens it, e.g. 
	```scala
flatten(List(1, 2, List(3, 4)))  // > List(1, 2, 3, 4)
	```
