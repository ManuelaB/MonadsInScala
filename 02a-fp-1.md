# Assignment 1: First Steps using the REPL

Try a few expressions

```scala
4 * 4
def x = 5
def z = 4.0
def mult(a: Double, b: Double): Double = a * b
```

Note that in a function definition, there is no `return` instruction; this is due to the substitution model!


# Call-By-Name and Call-By-Value

Consider the following definitions:

```scala
def test(x: Int, y: Int) = x * x

test(2, 3)
test(3+4, 9)
test(7, 2*4)
test(3+4, 2*4)
```

1. Which evaluation strategy is best for each of the function calls?
2. Find an expression that terminates under CBN but not under CBV


# Boolean operands as functions

Write functions `and` and `or` such that for all argument expressions `x` and `y`:

```scala
and(x, y) == x && y
or(x, y) == x || y
```

Do not use the `||` and `&&` operators; recall the substitution model and use `if-else`.

What are good operands to test that the equalities hold?


# Scopes

```scala
val x = 0
def f(y: Int) = y + 1
val result = {
	val x = f(3)
	x * x
} + x
```

What is the value of `result`?
- 0
- 16
- 32
- reduction does not terminate

# Recursion

## Pascal's Triangle

```
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1
```

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.
Write a function that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.


## Tail Recursion

```scala
def fact(n: Int): Int = 
	if (n == 0) 1 else n * fact(n - 1)

def fib(n: Int): Int = 
	if (n <= 1) n
	else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Implement tail recursive variants of `fact` and `fib`.

> Note: How would you implement the functions iteratively?


# Higher Order Functions

1. Write a function `prod` that calculates the product of the values of a function for the points on a given interval.<br>
	$$\prod_x f(x)$$
2. Write `fact` in terms of `prod`
3. Write a function that generalizes the `prod` function to arbitrary binary operands.


# Lists

For practice, implement 
```scala
trait IntList {
	def isEmpty: Boolean
	def head: Int
	def tail: IntList
	def nth(n: Int): Int  // returns the n-th element
}

class Cons ...

object Nil ...
```

Write a function `nth` that takes an integer `n` and a list, and seelcts the n-th element of that list (numbered from 0).

If the index is outside the valid range, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` should be thrown.


# Spare some change?

<https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_idx_722>

How many different ways can we make change of $1.00, given half-dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies? 
More generally, can we write a procedure to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of money with a list of coin denominations?

This problem has a simple solution as a recursive procedure.
Suppose we think of the types of coins available as arranged in some order.
Then the following relation holds:

The number of ways to change amount a using n kinds of coins equals
- the number of ways to change amount a using all but the first kind of coin, plus
- the number of ways to change amount a - d using all n kinds of coins, where d is the denomination of the first kind of coin.

To see why this is true, observe that the ways to make change can be divided into two groups: those that do not use any of the first kind of coin, and those that do.
Therefore, the total number of ways to make change for some amount is equal to the number of ways to make change for the amount without using any of the first kind of coin, plus the number of ways to make change assuming that we do use the first kind of coin.
But the latter number is equal to the number of ways to make change for the amount that remains after using a coin of the first kind.

Thus, we can recursively reduce the problem of changing a given amount to the problem of changing smaller amounts using fewer kinds of coins.
Consider this reduction rule carefully, and convince yourself that we can use it to describe an algorithm if we specify the following degenerate cases:

- If a is exactly 0, we should count that as 1 way to make change.
- If a is less than 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.
- If n is 0, we should count that as 0 ways to make change.


```scala
def change(amt: Int, denoms: List[Int]) =
	???
```
